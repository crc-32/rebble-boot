        <p>
            You're ready to Rebble, {{ name }}! To continue, make sure you have this page open on the device
            on which you use the official Pebble app.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you tap the button, the Pebble {{ os_display }} app will launch.
            {% if os == 'android' %}
                One of three things will then happen:
                <ul>
                    <li>A Rebble screen will appear.</li>
                    <li>The old Pebble login screen will appear. If this happens, close the app from the app switcher
                        and open it again. A Rebble screen should now appear.</li>
                    <li>Nothing. If this happens, tap &nbsp;<strong>â‹®</strong>&nbsp; in the top right corner, then tap
                        Settings. A Rebble screen should now appear.</li>
                </ul>
                In any case, once you tap the button on the Pebble app's "Welcome to Rebble" screen, you are done!
            {% else %}
                In order to continue setting up Rebble, once the Pebble app launches you will need to
                first <strong>wait a few seconds</strong>. Then tap the yellow exclamation mark in the top left corner
                and tap "log in". We'll see you there!
            {% endif %}
        </p>
        <p><a class="button" href="{{ link }}">Switch to Rebble</a></p>
    {% else %}
        <p>In order to continue, please head to <strong>{{ base }}</strong> on your phone.</p>
    {% endif %}
